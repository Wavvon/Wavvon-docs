# Alliances

Alliances are Wavvon's differentiator: named groups of hubs that share
channels, reactions, and (eventually) voice and games. A hub can be in
multiple alliances; users access alliance content through their home hub
without joining every member hub separately.

```
"WoW Alliance" = Hub A + Hub B
  Hub A shares #raids
  Hub B shares #guild-chat
  Users on Hub A see both. Users on Hub B see both.
```

## Tables

Defined in `hub/src/db/migrations.rs` (Wavvon-server):

- `alliances` — alliance id, name, creator, created_at. The `name` here
  is the **local label** this hub uses for the alliance; there is no
  canonical cross-hub name (see "Local labelling" below).
- `alliance_members` — alliance_id × hub_pubkey, with hub_name + hub_url
- `alliance_shared_channels` — alliance_id × channel_id (local channels
  the hub has chosen to share)
- `pending_alliance_invites` — alliance_id, from_hub_pubkey, from_hub_url,
  alliance_name (as labelled by the sender), optional message, invite
  token, created_at. Holds push-invite cards until the receiving admin
  accepts or declines.

| `POST   /alliances/:id/channels/:ch_id/messages`     | sender   | Post (federated to owning hub)       |

## Join flow

```
Hub A creates alliance        →  alliance_id (local)
Hub A: POST .../invite        →  signed invite token
Hub A → Hub B (out of band: paste link, etc.)
Hub B: POST .../join          →  authenticates to Hub A,
                                  Hub A verifies invite,
                                  both hubs persist membership
```

Out-of-band delivery is intentional — it's the same trust model as
sharing a server invite link in any community tool.

## Push invite flow (additive)

The pull flow above stays. Push invites are useful when the inviting
admin already knows the target hub's URL.

```
Hub A admin: Settings → Alliances → pick alliance → Invite tab
             "Send invite directly" — enters Hub B's URL + optional note
Hub A: POST /alliances/:id/push-invite { target_url, message? }
Hub A → Hub B: POST /federation/alliance-invite
               { alliance_id, alliance_name (Hub A's local label),
                 from_hub_url, message?, invite_token (Hub A-signed) }
Hub B: row in pending_alliance_invites; admins see card in
       Settings → Alliance invites (Accept / Decline)
Accept → same POST /alliances/:id/join as the pull flow,
         reusing the stored invite_token
Decline → row deleted, no callback
```

The receiving hub **polls `/alliances/pending-invites` on mount** of
the Alliance invites tab — no WebSocket push for this. The volume
(admin-to-admin, rare) doesn't justify a new realtime channel.

### Federation endpoint is unauthenticated

`POST /federation/alliance-invite` accepts unauthenticated POSTs. The
trust comes from the **invite token** inside the payload, which is a
Hub-A-identity signature over the alliance id (same primitive as the
pull-flow token). Anyone can drop a card in Hub B's pending list, but
accepting it triggers the normal join path — the join only succeeds
if the token verifies against Hub A's pubkey. A fake push invite at
worst clutters the pending list; it cannot create membership.

### Local labelling

The `alliance_name` shipped in the push payload is **Hub A's local
label** for the alliance. Hub B may store its own label after accept
and is never forced to adopt Hub A's. This matches the sovereignty
rule already implicit in the schema (`alliances.name` is per-hub) and
keeps the design symmetric with the pull flow, where Hub B picks the
name it stores at join time.

## Reading remote alliance messages

When Hub B fetches messages for an alliance channel that's owned by Hub A,
Hub B's `get_alliance_channel_messages` calls Hub A's federation endpoint
and caches results. For local channels, it loads from SQLite directly.
**Reactions are loaded in both branches** via
`messages::load_reactions` (the helper was made `pub(crate)` for this).

## What's not done

- Voice in alliance channels
- Game launch/lobby federation across alliance
- Member discovery beyond invite tokens
