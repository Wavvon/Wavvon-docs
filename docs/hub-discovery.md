# Hub Discovery

How users find hubs, and how hub operators get their communities in front
of people. Three complementary layers — each useful alone, powerful
together.

---

## The three layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Who it serves |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Deep links | `wavvon://` URI scheme + manual address entry | "I have a link or an address" |
| 2. Directory | Website + API the client fetches from | "Show me what's out there" |
| 3. Social graph | Signed public hub profiles on user pages | "Where are my friends?" |

Layer 1 ships first (pure client work, no new service). Layers 2 and 3
follow.

---

## Layer 1 — Deep links and address entry

### URI scheme

The Wavvon client registers a `wavvon://` custom URI scheme with the OS
via Tauri's deep-link plugin. Two forms:

```
wavvon://join/<host>              # public hub — no invite required
wavvon://join/<host>/<invite>     # private hub — invite code pre-filled
```

`<host>` is `hostname` or `hostname:port`. HTTPS is assumed; HTTP is
tried as a fallback for local/dev hosts.

Examples:
```
wavvon://join/hub.example.com
wavvon://join/hub.example.com:8080/xK9pQ3r
```

### Manual address entry

The "Add hub" dialog in the client grows a second input path: type or
paste a hostname (or a full `wavvon://` URL). The client resolves it the
same way as a deep link.

### Join preview flow

Both paths converge on the same sequence:

1. Client fetches `GET https://{host}/info` (public, no auth).
2. Client shows a **hub preview card**: name, icon, description,
   security level, whether approval is required.
3. User clicks **Join**. If an invite code is present it is used
   automatically. Otherwise the standard join / auth flow runs.

The preview card is also the component reused in the Directory (Layer 2)
and wherever a hub listing is rendered.

### Share button (hub admin)

Hub settings → Overview gains a **Share this hub** button. It generates
the correct `wavvon://join/<host>` URL (with or without an active invite
code the admin picks) and copies it to the clipboard. Optionally renders
a QR code for in-person sharing.

---

## Layer 2 — Hub directory

### Separate repository

The directory lives in a separate repo (`Wavvon-discovery`, a Next.js
project). Rationale: it is a web service with its own deployment
lifecycle (deploy a CSS fix without touching the desktop or hub
releases), its own CI/CD (Vercel / Cloudflare Pages), and a different
contributor profile (web developers who don't need Rust toolchains). The
API contract documented here is the boundary between repos.

### What the website is

A public-facing web application. Key pages:

- **`/`** — browseable, searchable hub listings (tag, language, name).
- **`/hub/<pubkey>`** — individual hub page with full listing, "Open in
  Wavvon" button (the `wavvon://` deep link), and a web-visible preview
  for users without the client.
- **`/submit`** — hub operators submit or update their listing.
- **`/about`** — what Wavvon is, download links.

The same listing data is served as a JSON API (see endpoints below) so
the desktop client can embed the directory natively.

### Hub listing schema

Fields stored per listing:

| Field | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hub_url` | Operator-supplied | Canonical URL of the hub |
| `hub_pubkey` | Scraped from `/info` | Used as the listing's stable ID |
| `name` | Scraped from `/info` | Refreshed periodically |
| `description` | Scraped from `/info` | Refreshed periodically |
| `icon` | Scraped from `/info` | Base64 data URL |
| `min_security_level` | Scraped from `/info` | PoW requirement |
| `invite_only` | Scraped from `/info` | Whether open or approval-gated |
| `invite_code` | Operator-supplied | Optional; for invite-only hubs |
| `bio` | Operator-supplied | Long-form description (Markdown) |
| `tags` | Operator-supplied | Array of strings, e.g. `["gaming","en"]` |
| `language` | Operator-supplied | BCP-47 code, e.g. `"en"`, `"it"` |
| `listed_at` | Server-assigned | Submission timestamp |
| `last_verified_at` | Server-assigned | Last successful `/info` scrape |

`hub_pubkey` (from `/info`) is the primary key — a listing is
permanently tied to the hub's cryptographic identity regardless of URL
changes.

### Cryptographic ownership proof

Every hub has an Ed25519 keypair (`hub_identity.json`). Only the hub
operator holds the private key. Listings are therefore owned by proof,
not by account:

**Signing payload** (canonical — deterministic serialisation):
```json
{
  "hub_url": "https://hub.example.com",
  "tags": ["gaming", "en"],
  "language": "en",
  "bio": "...",
  "nonce": "<ISO-8601 timestamp, rounded to the minute>"
}
```

The hub signs this with its private key. The directory service:

1. Fetches `GET {hub_url}/info` to get the hub's `public_key`.
2. Verifies the signature against the canonical payload.
3. Rejects if the nonce is more than 5 minutes old (replay protection).
4. Stores the listing, keyed on `hub_pubkey`.

**Update / delete**: same scheme — operator signs a new payload (update)
or a `{"action":"delete","hub_pubkey":"...","nonce":"..."}` payload
(delete). No account recovery, no password reset — if you lose the hub
key you lose listing ownership.

### Signing flow from the admin UI

Hub settings → Overview → **Submit to directory** button. On click:

1. Desktop client calls a new Tauri command `sign_directory_listing`.
2. Command POSTs to the hub's own new endpoint
   `POST /admin/directory-sign` (authenticated, admin only) with the
   operator-supplied fields (tags, language, bio, invite code).
3. Hub signs the canonical payload with its private key and returns
   `{ signature, hub_pubkey, canonical_payload }`.
4. Client POSTs to the directory API `POST /api/hubs` with the signed
   bundle.
5. Client shows success / error.

The hub's private key never leaves the server.

### Anti-spam

- Submissions require solving a PoW puzzle (same SHA-256 primitive
  already in `identity/src/pow.rs` in Wavvon-server). Level TBD — high
  enough to deter bulk fake listings, low enough that a single legit
  submission takes under a second.
- The directory service re-verifies (`/info` scrape) listings on a
  schedule (e.g. every 24 h). Listings whose hub URL stops responding
  are flagged, then removed after a grace period.
- Abuse reporting UI on each listing page; flagged listings are hidden
  pending manual review.

### API contract

All endpoints return `application/json`.

```
GET  /api/hubs
     ?q=<search>          full-text search across name + bio
     &tag=<tag>           filter by tag (repeatable: &tag=gaming&tag=en)
     &language=<bcp47>    filter by language
     &page=<n>            pagination (default 1, 20 per page)

→ { hubs: HubListing[], total: number, page: number }

GET  /api/hubs/:pubkey
→ HubListing | 404

POST /api/hubs
     body: { hub_url, tags, language, bio, invite_code?,
             canonical_payload, hub_pubkey, signature }
→ 201 HubListing | 400 | 409 (already listed, use PUT)

PUT  /api/hubs/:pubkey
     body: same as POST
→ 200 HubListing | 400 | 403 (signature mismatch)

DELETE /api/hubs/:pubkey
     body: { canonical_payload, hub_pubkey, signature }
→ 204 | 403
```

`HubListing` shape (TypeScript reference):
```typescript
interface HubListing {
  hub_pubkey: string;      // hex Ed25519 public key — stable ID
  hub_url: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string | null;     // base64 data URL
  invite_only: boolean;
  min_security_level: number;
  invite_code: string | null;
  bio: string;
  tags: string[];
  language: string;
  listed_at: string;       // ISO-8601
  last_verified_at: string;
}
```

### Client Discover tab

A new top-level view in the desktop client alongside DMs and hubs. It
fetches from the directory API (URL configurable in client settings,
defaults to the official instance). Shows:

- Search bar + tag/language filter chips
- Grid of hub cards (icon, name, tags, language, short description)
- Clicking a card → hub preview modal (same component as Layer 1 join
  flow) → Join button

The configured directory URL defaults to the official Wavvon instance
but can be pointed at any self-hosted directory.

## Layer 3 — Social hub profiles

### What it is

Each user can publish a **signed list of hubs** they want others to see.
Stored on their home hub, signed by the user's identity key. Anyone who
knows a user's public key can fetch it.

### Hub endpoint

```
GET /profile/:pubkey
→ {
    pubkey: string,
    display_name: string,
    avatar: string | null,
    public_hubs: PublicHubEntry[],
    signature: string        // signs canonical(pubkey + public_hubs + issued_at)
  }

interface PublicHubEntry {
  hub_url: string;
  hub_name: string;          // cached at signing time
  joined_at: string;
}
```

The endpoint is publicly readable without auth. The signature lets any
client verify the list was produced by the user, not the hub operator.

### Client integration

- User settings → Account → **Public hub profile** toggle + hub
  checklist (which of your hubs you want to make visible).
- On another user's profile card (DM list, member list), a **Hubs in
  common** or **Their hubs** section shows their public list with "Join"
  buttons.
- The directory website (`/user/:pubkey`) can display a user's public
  hubs as a shareable page.

### Deferred design questions

- Cross-hub profile lookup: if you meet someone on Hub A but their
  profile is signed on Hub B, how does Hub A's client find Hub B's
  `/profile` endpoint? One answer: the profile includes a
  `home_hub_url`; the client fetches from there. Needs more thought.
- Profile update propagation: when a user changes their public hub list,
  old cached copies on other hubs are stale. Probably fine to treat as
  eventually consistent given federation latency is already unbounded.

## Implementation order

1. **Layer 1: deep links + address entry + hub preview card** — pure
   client work, no new service. Adds `wavvon://` registration, reworks
   the "Add hub" dialog, adds the Share button to hub admin.
2. **Layer 2: directory API + website** — in the `Wavvon-discovery`
   repo. Parallel work: hub-side signing endpoint + Tauri command +
   "Submit to directory" UI.
3. **Layer 2: client Discover tab** — wires the directory API into the
   desktop client once the API is live.
4. **Layer 3: public profiles** — new hub endpoint + client UI. Design
   cross-hub lookup before starting.

---

## Open questions

- **Official directory URL** — `discovery.wavvon.io`? Needs a domain.
- **PoW level for submissions** — balance against "legit submission
  should be instant". Start at level 10 (under 1 second), raise if
  spammed.
- **Scrape frequency for live data** — member counts aren't in `/info`
  today. Add them, or leave member count out of listings?
- **Hub-initiated delisting** — if a hub goes private after listing,
  should the `/info` scrape automatically remove it? Probably yes if
  `invite_only` flips to true and no invite code is stored.
- **Tech stack for `Wavvon-discovery`** — Next.js (TypeScript, SSR,
  easy Vercel deploy) is what the repo ships with, a natural fit given
  the desktop client is already TypeScript/React.
